Trading cryptocurrency contracts for differences is a highly speculative investment because prices of cryptocurrencies can go up and down — potentially to a worthless (zero) value. Investing in cryptocurrency contracts for differences through leveraged accounts amplifies this underlying volatility risk, making the change in prices even more significant. When the client invests in a leveraged contract for differences related to cryptocurrencies, the client's profit or loss is based on the leveraged ratio that the client has set for the client's account. If the price movement is in the client's favour, returns generated are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. However, if the price movement is against the client's favour, the client will suffer losses that are multiple times higher than the amount set aside from the client's account balance to open and maintain a transaction. The client should not trade in cryptocurrencies unless the client fully understands and is aware that trades and/or investments involving cryptocurrencies are complex and high risk in nature, and the client not only risks incurring significant losses over a short period of time but also risks losing all the client's invested capital."

msgid "Trading in Binary Options is speculative and involves a high degree of risk that can result in the loss of the client's entire investment. Therefore, trading in Binary Options is appropriate only for persons that understand and are willing to assume the economic, legal, and other risks involved in such transactions. The client should be satisfied that Binary Options trading is suitable for the client in light of the client's investment circumstances and attitude towards risk before trading. The client should not engage in speculative Binary Options trading unless the client understands the basic aspects of such trading and its risks. If the client is in any doubt as to whether Binary Option trading is appropriate and suitable for the client, the client should seek independent advice from an investment consulting professional. %1 does not provide such advice. It is the client's responsibility, taking into account the client's personal circumstances and investment resources, to take particular care and make careful considerations independently, both prior to applying to engage in Binary Options with %1 and prior to making any individual order. Where the client does not understand the risks involved in applying for a trading account with %1 or in making any individual order, the client should seek advice and consultation from an independent investment advisor. If the client continues to not understand the risks involved in trading in Binary Options, the client should not trade at all."
